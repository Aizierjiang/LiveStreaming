## Supplementary Material / Folder Structure

- [This repository](./) contains all the needed scripts including the backend for replicating the framework for live streaming.
- [This folder](./Unity3DProject/) contains the Unity 3D project which I implemented via Unity 3D version `Unity3D 2018.4.16f1`. Note that "EasyMovieTexture" plugin is not uploaded because it's copyright, but you can download it elsewhere or directly use other related plugins to replace it.
- [This folder](./SimpleLiveServer/) contains the simple server I wrote using `ThinkPHP5` for demonstrating some functions for my framework.
- [This folder](./WSHTTPServerTemplate/) contains the scripts I used for demonstrating the `WebSocket` and `HTTP` functionalities of the application based on my framework. The scripts are generalized by myself to make it modular so that you can directly use the template to achieve some communication related functionalities using the template.   
- [This folder](./LaTeXTemplate) serves as the LaTeX template I used for crafting the paper.
- [This site](https://harzing.com/resources/publish-or-perish) contains the software I utilized for collecting and searching the desired papers.
- [This](A_3D_Framework_for_Enhancing_LowLatency_MultiChannel_Live_Streaming-arxiv.pdf) is the duplicate of the paper downloaded from [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/NOT_YET_UPLOADED), which is the **full version** that I recommend.
- [This](A_3D_Framework_for_Enhancing_LowLatency_MultiChannel_Live_Streaming.pdf) is the duplicate of the manuscript I submitted to the conference. **Due to page limitation, some content has been omitted**.
